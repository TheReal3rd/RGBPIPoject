RGB Pi Project


This is a simple project to create a RGB strip controlled using a Raspberry pi 1. Yea that old thing.

My main goal is to add sound reacting to the strip and have it automatically change patterns and colour based on the played music. Using either a microphone or audio jack as an input. 
Alongside adding a web panel that can be used to control the strip aswell.
